# Complex-photonics
Photons occupying multiple spatial modes hold a great promise for implementing high-dimensional quantum communication. We use spontaneous four wave mixing to generate multimode photon pairs in a few mode fiber. We show the photons are correlated in the fiber mode basis using an all-fiber mode sorter. Our demonstration paves the way to realization of high-dimensional quantum protocols based on standard, commercially available, fibers in an all-fiber configuration.
